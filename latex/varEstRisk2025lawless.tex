\noindent \textbf{Background}:
Accurate interpretation of genetic variants requires a quantitative estimate of how likely a variant is to contribute to disease, accounting for both observed and unobserved causal alleles across different inheritance modes.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Methods}:
We developed a statistical framework that computes genome-wide prior probabilities for variant classification by integrating population allele frequencies, disease classifications, and Hardy-Weinberg expectations across dominant, recessive, and X-linked inheritance. Bayesian modelling then combines these priors with individual-level data to produce credible intervals that quantify diagnostic confidence.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Results}:
The framework replaces categorical variant classification with continuous posterior probabilities that capture residual uncertainty from incomplete or missing genotype data. Demonstrations in three diagnostic scenarios show accurate quantification of variant-level disease relevance. Application to 557 genes implicated in inborn errors of immunity (IEI) generated a public database of prior probabilities. Integration with protein-protein interaction and immunophenotypic data revealed gene-level constraint patterns, and validation in national cohorts showed close agreement between predicted and observed case numbers.

\noindent \textbf{Conclusions}:
Our method addresses a long-standing gap in clinical genomics by quantifying both observed and unobserved genetic evidence in disease diagnosis. It provides a reproducible probabilistic foundation for variant interpretation, clinical decision-making, and large-scale genomic analysis.

\section{Introduction}
Accurately estimating the probability that a patient carries a disease-causing genetic variant remains a central challenge in clinical and statistical genetics. For over a century, attention has focused on identifying variants which are \ac{tp} and reducing \ac{fp}, while \ac{fn} and \ac{tn} have received comparatively little consideration. \ac{fn} arise when pathogenic variants are missed due to technical or interpretive limits, and \ac{tn} represent the vast background of benign variants. Although \ac{tn} have clear value in contexts such as cancer screening, their wider statistical and clinical relevance remains underused. From a probabilistic standpoint, \ac{fn} and \ac{tn} provide crucial information about what is not observed, what should be expected under baseline genetic assumptions, and how confident one can be in the absence of a pathogenic finding. Current variant interpretation frameworks rarely quantify these dimensions, resulting in bias towards known \ac{tp} and a lack of principled priors for genome-wide disease probability estimation.

Quantifying the risk that a patient inherits a disease-causing variant is a core problem in genomics. Classical approaches based on \ac{hwe} \cite{MayoCentury2008, AbramovsHardyWeinberg2020} have long provided the foundation for calculating variant probabilities. However, these models become more complex when extended to different \ac{moi}, such as \ac{ar}, \ac{ad}, or \ac{xl} disorders. In \ac{ar} diseases, risk depends on both homozygosity and compound heterozygosity, whereas a single allele can cause disease in \ac{ad} or \ac{xl} forms. Modern evidence shows that \ac{moi} can be further modulated by mechanisms including dominant negative effects, haploinsufficiency, mosaicism, and digenic or epistatic interactions \cite{zschocke_mendelian_2023}. Although \citet{karczewski2020mutational} advanced the field considerably, applying statistical genomics data across all \ac{moi} for any gene–disease combination remains unresolved. Recent disease-specific estimates, including Wilson disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and treatable metabolic disorders \cite{bick_estimating_2025, evans_estimating_2021}, as reviewed by \citet{hannah_using_2024}, demonstrate progress but remain limited in scope.

All existing approaches remain limited to single \ac{moi}, specific disorders, or narrow gene sets. An integrated model is needed to unify these perspectives and generate probabilities that can serve as informative priors in a Bayesian framework for variant and disease probability estimation. Such a framework extends classical \ac{hwe}-based methods, strengthens clinical interpretation by clarifying expected genetic outcomes, and enhances analytical models used in statistical genomics.

The resulting dataset from these necessary calculations also holds value for AI and reinforcement learning applications, providing an enriched version of the data underpinning frameworks such as AlphaFold \cite{jumper_highly_2021} and AlphaMissense \cite{cheng_accurate_2023}.

This gap has persisted largely due to the historical absence of harmonised reference datasets. Only recently have resources become available to enable rigorous genome-wide probability estimation, including population allele frequencies (gnomAD v4 \cite{karczewski2020mutational}), curated variant classifications (ClinVar \cite{landrum_clinvar_2018}), functional annotations (UniProt \cite{the_uniprot_consortium_uniprot_2025}), and pathogenicity prediction models (AlphaMissense \cite{cheng_accurate_2023}). We previously introduced PanelAppRex to integrate gene panel data from sources such as \ac{ge} PanelApp, ClinVar, and \ac{uniprot}, enabling structured, machine-readable datasets for variant discovery and interpretation \cite{lawless_panelapprex_2025, martin_panelapp_2019, landrum_clinvar_2018, the_uniprot_consortium_uniprot_2025}. Together, these advances now allow systematic modelling of the expected distribution of variant types, frequencies, and classifications across the genome.

By reframing variant interpretation as a problem of calibrated expectation rather than reactive confirmation, our framework enables clinicians and researchers to anticipate both observed and unobserved pathogenic burdens. This scalable, genome-wide approach aims to improve diagnostic efficiency, reduce uncertainty in inconclusive cases, inform genetic epidemiology and statistical modelling, and supports the translation of genomic data into patient care.

In this study, we report genome-wide probabilities of disease observation across gene-disease combinations, focusing on known \ac{iei} genes, also referred to as \ac{pid} or monogenic inflammatory bowel disease genes \cite{poli_human_2025, lawless_panelapprex_2025, martin_panelapp_2019}. This well-defined genotype-phenotype set, comprising more than 500 gene-disease associations, provides a robust validation of clinical relevance. The latest \ac{iuis} classification and diagnostic guidelines \cite{poli_human_2025, bousfiha_2024_2025} serve as the benchmark reference. We hypothesised that by integrating curated annotations on population \ac{af}, disease phenotypes, \ac{moi} patterns, and variant classifications with \ac{hwe}-based calculations, it would be possible to estimate expected probabilities of disease-associated variants and derive quantitative confidence in genetic diagnosis using these priors.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Occurrence probability across disease genes}
\label{sec:pro_obs}
Our study integrated large-scale annotation databases with gene panels from PanelAppRex to systematically assess disease genes by \ac{moi} 
\cite{lawless_panelapprex_2025}. 
By combining population allele frequencies with ClinVar clinical classifications, we computed an expected occurrence probability for each SNV, representing the likelihood of encountering a variant of a specific pathogenicity for a given phenotype. We report these probabilities for 54,814 ClinVar variant classifications across 557 genes (linked dataset \cite{lawless_2025_15111584}).

%In practice, our approach computed a simple observation probability for every SNV across the genome and was applicable to any disease-gene panel. Here, 
We focused on panels related to Primary Immunodeficiency or Monogenic Inflammatory Bowel Disease, using PanelAppRex panel ID 398.
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_varRisEst_summary_scores}} displays all reported ClinVar  variant classifications for this panel. The resulting natural scaling system (-5 to +5) accounts for the frequently encountered combinations of classification labels (e.g. benign to pathogenic).
The resulting dataset \cite{lawless_2025_15111584} is briefly shown in \textbf{Table \ref{tab:head_result_table}} to illustrate that our method yielded estimates of the probability of observing a variant for every particular ClinVar classification. 

%This framework, of pre-calculated disease-related variant occurrence probabilities, enabled comprehensive analyses across the entire genome, paving the way for rapid assessment of variant significance in diverse disease contexts.

\subsection{Integrating observed true positives and unobserved false negatives into a single, actionable conclusion}
\label{sec:intregrate_tp_fn}

Having established a probabilistic framework for estimating the prior probability of observing disease-associated variants under different inheritance modes, we then applied this model to an example patient to demonstrate its potential for clinical genetics.
% For each gene, we used the computed prior probabilities for all variant classifications, (e.g. benign, uncertain, and pathogenic). 
The algorithm first verified that all known pathogenic positions have been sequenced and observed as reference (true negatives), and identified any positions that were either observed as variant (true positives) or not assessable due to missing sequence data of failed \ac{qc}.
These missing sites represent potential false negatives. 
By jointly modelling the observed and unobserved space, the method yielded a calibrated, evidence-weighted probability that at least one damaging causal variant could be present within a gene.

\subsection{Scenario one - complete coverage and simple diagnosis}
We present the results from three scenarios for an example single-case patient being investigated for the genetic diagnosis of \ac{iei}.
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:plot_scenario_1_quant_uncert_ci}} shows the results of the first simple scenario, in which only one known pathogenic variant, \ac{nfkb1} \texttt{p.Ser237Ter}, was observed and all other previously reported pathogenic positions were successfully sequenced and confirmed as reference. 
In this setting, the model assigned the full posterior probability to the observed allele, yielding 100\,\% confidence that all present evidence supported a single, true positive causal explanation. 
The most strongly supported observed variant was \texttt{p.Ser237Ter} (posterior: 0.594). 
The strongest (probability of observing) non-sequenced variant was a benign variant \texttt{p.Thr567Ile} (posterior: 0). 
The total probability of a causal diagnosis given the available evidence was 1 (95\% CI: 1--1) (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:table_scenario_1_quant_uncert_ci}}). 

\subsection{Scenario two - incomplete coverage and complex diagnosis}

\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}} illustrates the second scenario, where the same pathogenic \ac{nfkb1} variant \texttt{p.Ser237Ter} was detected, but sequencing coverage was incomplete at three additional classified sites. Among these was the likely pathogenic splice-site variant \texttt{c.159+1G{\small\textgreater}A}, which was not captured in the sequencing data. The panels in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(A–F)} show the incremental integration of observed and missing evidence, resulting in a posterior probability that reflects both confirmed findings and residual uncertainty. Supporting metrics and reporting conclusions are summarised in \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:table_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}} and \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:table_scenario_2_report}}.

Bayesian integration of all annotated alleles produced quantitative \ac{cri}s for pathogenic attribution that (i) preserve Hardy-Weinberg expectations, (ii) accommodate \ac{ad}, \ac{ar}, and \ac{xl} inheritance, and (iii) quantify uncertainty from unsequenced or failed-\ac{qc} sites.

\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(A)} depicts the prior distribution partitioned by observed or missing status and by causal evidence, coloured by ClinVar score. \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(B)} shows posterior normalisation, concentrating probability density on two high-evidence alleles. \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(C)} displays the per-variant posterior probability of being damaging and causal, highlighting the confirmed nonsense variant \texttt{p.Ser237Ter} and the missing splice-donor \texttt{c.159+1G{\small\textgreater}A}. \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(D)} restricts the view to causal candidates, showing posterior mass across these two variants. \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(E)} decomposes total damaging probability into observed (40,\%) and missing (34,\%) components, and \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}~(F)} summarises the gene-level posterior, with a median probability of 0.542 (95,\% \ac{cri}: 0.264-0.8).

Numerically, the present variant \texttt{p.Ser237Ter} contributes 0.399 of the posterior share and the missing splice-donor allele \texttt{c.159+1G{\small\textgreater}A} contributes 0.339, with remaining alleles contributing negligibly (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:table_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}}). For this patient scenario, the probability of correct genetic diagnosis due to \ac{nfkb1} \texttt{p.Ser237Ter} is 0.542 (95,\% \ac{cri}: 0.264-0.8), reflecting the remaining uncertainty from an unconfirmed alternative allele. If the second variant is confirmed absent, the confidence increases to 1 (95,\% \ac{cri}: 1–1), consistent with scenario one.

\subsection{Scenario three - currently impossible diagnosis}

\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_3_quant_uncert_ci}} shows the third scenario, where no observed variants were detected in the proband for \ac{nfkb1}. Instead, a broad range of plausible \ac{fn}s were identified as missing for \ac{tnfaip3}. The strongest of these unsequenced variants was \texttt{p.Cys243Arg} (posterior: 0.347). However, the total probability of a causal diagnosis for the patient \emph{given the available evidence} was 0 (95,\% CI: 0-0), since these missing variants must be explicitly accounted for (\textbf{Table~\ref{tab:table_scenario_3_quant_uncert_ci}}). Upon confirmation, these probabilities can update as shown in scenario two.

\subsection{Posterior probabilities quantify competing variant hypotheses}

The three scenarios deliberately remove the distraction of other genome-wide candidate variants, which are assumed as present and accounted for within the model. In practice, the same posterior probability and \ac{cri} calculations are performed across all qualifying variants, and multiple variants often carry non-negligible probabilities in real diagnostic settings.
In real-world diagnostics, we commonly find multiple variants to carry non-negligible probabilities. 
Our framework explicitly quantifies these competing hypotheses, enabling a ranked interpretation that reflects the totality of evidence. 
Overlapping \ac{cri} do not indicate ambiguity in the method, but rather a principled measure of remaining uncertainty. 
This output can directly inform follow-up actions, such as functional validation or treatment trials, and supports the use of CrI thresholds as a transparent decision-making aid when data are incomplete or equivocal.

The sequential steps towards the posterior  probability of complete genetic diagnosis are shown:

\subsection{Quantifying variant probabilities improves classification of inborn errors of immunity}

\subsubsection*{Genes with high pathogenic variant burden show structured network constraint}

%\subsubsection*{Genetic constraint in high-impact protein networks}
We applied the framework to \ac{iei}, a disease area in which we have expertise and which offers a well-curated gene set to validate genome-wide estimates and demonstrate potential applications \cite{poli_human_2025}. Because pathogenicity in \ac{iei} often reflects shared molecular pathways, we integrated ClinVar-derived variant probabilities with \ac{ppi} data to quantify per-gene pathogenic burden and assess whether constraint clusters within specific networks, consistent with known \ac{iei} categories and immunophenotypes \cite{szklarczyk2025string, karczewski2020mutational}.


%\subsubsection*{Score-positive-total reveals genes with the highest pathogenic variant burden}
ClinVar classifications (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_varRisEst_summary_scores}}) were scaled from -5 to +5 by pathogenicity. 
We summed all positive (potentially damaging) scores per gene to derive the score-positive-total metric. 
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:ppi_network_assoc} (A)} shows the \ac{ppi} network, with node size and colour proportional to this metric (log-transformed). 
The top 15 genes with the highest total prior probabilities of disease association are labelled, consistent with \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_varRisEst_summary_scores}}.



% \subsubsection*{Variant burden varies across IEI categories but without significant pairwise differences}
One-way \ac{anova} indicated that major \ac{iei} categories differed in score-positive-total values (\(F(8,500)=2.82,\,p=0.0046\)), suggesting uneven distributions of pathogenic variant burden (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:ppi_network_assoc} (B)}). 
However, Tukey \ac{hsd} post hoc tests (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:ppi_network_assoc} (C)}) showed overlapping 95\% \ac{ci}s for all pairwise comparisons, indicating that category-level differences were not individually significant.


\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection*{Constrained subnetworks reveal distinct functional disease signatures}

% \subsubsection*{UMAP projection separates constrained hub genes from variant-enriched subnetworks}
To visualise the dense \ac{ppi} network, we applied \ac{umap} projection (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_umap}}). 
Node size represents interaction degree, and colours denote cluster membership \cite{szklarczyk2025string}. 
Blue labels mark hub genes (degree above the 95th percentile), and yellow labels indicate the top 15 genes by score-positive-total. 
Genes with high pathogenic variant loads segregated from highly connected nodes, suggesting that \ac{lof} in hubs is constrained, whereas damaging variants in less connected genes exert more specific effects.

The separation indicates that genes with high pathogenic variant loads differ from highly connected nodes.
  }

\end{figure}

% \subsubsection*{Complement and bone marrow failure genes cluster within high-burden protein subnetworks}
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:patch2}} shows a heatmap of standardised residuals for major disease categories across network clusters, corresponding to \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_umap}}. 
The dendrogram groups categories with similar enrichment profiles, and the accompanying bar plot highlights the strongest enrichment signal per category. 
\ac{cd} (8) and \ac{bmf} (9) show the highest enrichment values, indicating that their genes cluster within specific protein subnetworks carrying a high burden of damaging variants. 
Although all categories exceeded the nominal significance threshold (\(|\mathrm{residual}| > 2\)), this reflects concentrated variant effects in select clusters rather than uniform enrichment across all groups; particularly cluster 4 for category 8.

% \subsubsection*{Gene connectivity and LOEUF constraint reveal pathway-specific intolerance}
Building on \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:patch2}}, we assessed the relationship between \ac{ppi} connectivity (degree) and \ac{lof} constraint (\ac{loeuf} upper rank) \cite{karczewski2020mutational} using Spearman’s correlation. 
A weak but significant negative correlation ($\rho=-0.181$, $p=0.00024$) indicated that highly connected genes tend to be more constrained. 
No clear visual pattern was observed at the global level (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_umap_const}}), likely due to network density. 
When stratified by gene cluster \cite{szklarczyk2025string}, stronger relationships emerged. For example, cluster 2 ($\rho=-0.375$, $p=0.000994$) and cluster 4 ($\rho=-0.800$, $p<0.000001$) showed clear associations, suggesting shared mechanisms of \ac{lof} intolerance within specific pathways.
The score-positive-total metric effectively summarised aggregate pathogenic burden and highlighted genes under strong selective constraint.  
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_cor_spear_rho_sig_clust_patch3} (C, D)} displays re-plotted networks for clusters with significant \ac{ppi}-\ac{loeuf} correlations, where node size reflects variant burden and colour indicates score intensity.

% \subsubsection*{New insight from functional enrichment}
To interpret clusters with the highest damaging variant load (clusters 2 and 4 in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:p_cor_spear_rho_sig_clust_patch3}}), we performed enrichment using MsigDB and FUMA \cite{watanabe_functional_2017}, including GWAS Catalog and Immunologic Signatures datasets.  Composite enrichment profiles (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:fuma_merge}}) linked these clusters to distinct disease-related phenotypes, providing functional context beyond traditional \ac{iuis} classifications \cite{poli_human_2025}.  GTEx v8 expression data across 54 tissues (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:expHeatmaps}}) supported these associations.   Cluster 2 genes were enriched for inflammatory and autoimmune traits as well as immune cell and serum protein features.  This included ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Cluster 4 genes were linked to ocular and complement-related phenotypes, including age-related macular degeneration, complement biomarkers (C3, C4, factor H-related proteins), nephropathy, and pulmonary traits.



\subsubsection*{Accounting for genome-wide relationships and linkage disequilibrium}

\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:karyo_locusplot_merged} (A)} presents a genome-wide karyoplot of all \ac{iei} panel genes mapped to GRCh38, coloured by \ac{moi}. 
Panels \textbf{(B)} and \textbf{(C)} show regional locus plots for \textit{NFKB1} and \textit{CFTR}. 
In \textbf{(B)}, only benign variants such as p.Ala475Gly display high observation probabilities in the \ac{ad} gene \textit{NFKB1}, which is highly intolerant to \ac{lof}. 
In contrast, \textbf{(C)} shows elevated probabilities for pathogenic variants in \textit{CFTR}, consistent with its well-established disease association. 
Analysis of \ac{ld} using $\text{R}^2$ demonstrates that regions of high linkage can be effectively modelled, enabling separation of independent variant signals within complex loci.

\subsubsection*{Novel PID classifications from integrated genetic and clinical features}
Traditional \ac{iuis} \ac{iei} classifications use free-text descriptions that hinder automated or machine learning analyses (e.g.\ ``decreased CD8, normal or decreased CD4''). 
We simplified 315 immunophenotypic features into binary categories (normal vs.\ not-normal) for T cells, B cells, \ac{ig}, and neutrophils (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:immunophenotype_before_after}}). 
Mapping these simplified profiles to STRINGdb \ac{ppi} clusters revealed significant non-random distributions ($\chi^2 < 1e{-13}$; \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_multicat_patch_3_clust_chi}}), indicating that network structure reflects key immunophenotypic variation. 
Across four classifiers, predictive accuracy increased from 33\% using phenotypes alone to 61\% when combining phenotypes with \ac{iuis} categories (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:multicat_performance_combined}}), with \ac{ig} and T-cell abnormalities among the top predictors. 
The final \ac{ppi}-immunophenotype model defined 17 data-driven PID groups (expanded to 33 with full \ac{iuis} categories). 
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:pid_class_tree_distribution}} shows the 17-group decision tree, where each terminal node represents a distinct immunophenotypic signature. 
This data-driven taxonomy refines traditional \ac{iuis} \ac{iei} groupings and provides a structured, machine-readable scaffold for large-scale computational and predictive analyses. Alternative \ac{ppi} embeddings incorporating additional molecular features can be easily integrated to extend these classifications.

\subsection{Observed variant likelihood is independent of AlphaMissense pathogenicity}
AlphaMissense (and similar tools) assigns pathogenicity scores to all possible amino acid substitutions, yet \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:alphamissense}} shows that variants most frequently observed in patients are predominantly benign or of uncertain significance. This highlights the gap between predicting pathogenic potential and estimating how likely a variant is to occur, providing a quantitative basis for improving predictive models.
Comparison of \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:alphamissense}~(A)} with \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:p_varRisEst_summary_scores}~(D)} illustrates the distribution of classifications.
A Kruskal-Wallis test (\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:alphamissense_kw}}) found no meaningful differences in variant observation probability across AlphaMissense classification groups. This indicates that current pathogenicity predictors estimate how damaging a variant may be, but not how likely it is to be observed in patients. The weak inverse trends likely reflect underlying effects of \ac{moi} and \ac{lof} intolerance.

\subsection{Integration of variant observation probabilities into the IEI genetics framework}
We integrated prior probabilities of observing variants across all genes associated with each phenotype \cite{poli_human_2025}, covering \ac{ad}, \ac{ar}, and \ac{xl} \ac{moi}, into the \ac{iei} genetics framework. 
These gene-level priors, derived from curated PanelAppRex panels, provide new quantitative insights into disease-gene relationships. 
The final output includes machine- and human-readable datasets, accessible through the linked repository \cite{lawless_2025_15111584}, and a web interface incorporating these probability metrics (\url{https://iei-genetics.github.io}).
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:var_risk_est_iei_genetics}} shows the user interface integrating variant-level priors with clinical and functional data. 
Pre-computed summary statistics and significance metrics are presented alongside sparkline box plots summarising key quantiles (min, Q1, median, Q3, max) for each gene. 
Each record links dynamically to external databases (e.g.\ ClinVar, \ac{omim}, AlphaFold) as described in \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:pro_obs}}. 
All prepared data are available for direct bioinformatic use \cite{lawless_2025_15111584}, as detailed in \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:intregrate_tp_fn}}.

\section{Discussion}

% 1. Occurrence probability across disease genes
We present, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide framework for quantifying prior probabilities of observing disease-associated variants and for performing evidence-aware genetic diagnosis with \ac{cri} \cite{hannah_using_2024, bick_estimating_2025}. By integrating population allele frequencies (\ac{gnomad}) \cite{karczewski2020mutational}, curated classifications (ClinVar) \cite{landrum_clinvar_2018}, and functional annotations (\ac{dbnsfp}), with classical \ac{hwe}-based models, we derived probabilistic estimates for 54,814 ClinVar variant classifications across 557 \ac{iei} genes linked to \ac{pid} and monogenic inflammatory bowel disease \cite{lawless_panelapprex_2025, poli_human_2025}. 
Although demonstrated in \ac{iei}, the framework generalises to all inheritance modes: \ac{ad} and \ac{xl} requiring a single pathogenic allele, and \ac{ar} involving homozygous or compound heterozygous variants. These \ac{hwe}-based priors provide a baseline for Bayesian inference, now feasible at scale through comprehensive genomic databases \cite{landrum_clinvar_2018, karczewski2020mutational, lawless_panelapprex_2025, cheng_accurate_2023}.

% 2. Integrating observed true positives and unobserved false negatives into a single actionable conclusion
A persistent limitation in clinical genetics is the focus on confirming only observed \ac{tp} variants. Our framework addresses this by integrating both observed and unobserved evidence into a single quantitative conclusion. We derived per-variant priors across all \ac{moi} and combined these with the patient's genotype data to yield posterior probabilities representing the likelihood of carrying a damaging causal allele. As shown in \textbf{Table~\ref{tab:table_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}} and \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:plot_scenario_2_quant_uncert_ci}}, this approach provides a clinically interpretable probability that unifies confirmed and potentially missed variants. When whole-genome data are unavailable, the score-positive-total metric offers a practical, evidence-based method for ranking candidate genes and guiding diagnosis in phenotypically overlapping cases.

% 0. Deficiencies
Our current framework had several limitations. It focuses primarily on \ac{snv}s and does not yet incorporate structural variants, de novo mutations, hypomorphic alleles, overdominance, variable penetrance, tissue-specific effects, or phenomena such as the Wahlund effect and pleiotropy \cite{zschocke_mendelian_2023}. Future extensions could include factors such as embryonic lethality, condition-specific penetrance, and age of onset \cite{hannah_using_2024}. The present analysis also assumes random mating, large population size, and no migration, mutation, or selection.  
We demonstrated genome-wide gene distribution and \ac{moi} for the \ac{iei} panel in relation to \ac{ld}, confirming both feasibility and relevance. However, accurate \ac{ld} estimation requires population-specific, genome-wide pairwise genotype data. Our use of global reference allele frequencies improves generalisability but may reduce precision relative to population-specific estimates.

% 3. Scenario one – simple diagnosis
% 4. Scenario two – complex diagnosis
% 5. Scenario three – currently impossible diagnosis
Across the diagnostic scenarios, our framework quantified the probability that any variant (pathogenic, benign, or uncertain) is both observed and causally relevant to disease. In the illustrated examples, this enabled confident attribution to a known pathogenic variant while accounting for a missed but plausible splice-site allele. Scenario two captured a common challenge where confirmed and unobserved candidates jointly influence diagnostic confidence. Unlike conventional methods that assess only \ac{tp}s, our approach quantifies residual uncertainty and produces structured, ``evidence-aware'' reports distinguishing confirmed, excluded, and plausible variants.  
Combined with genome-wide priors from PanelAppRex, this framework applies to any phenotype by integrating variant classification, allele frequency, \ac{moi}, and sequencing quality metrics, providing a scalable foundation for probabilistic, evidence-aware diagnostics in clinical genomics.

% Probability model
Estimating disease risk in genetic studies is complicated by uncertainties in key parameters such as variant penetrance and the fraction of cases attributable to specific variants \cite{zschocke_mendelian_2023}. 
In the simplest model, where a single, fully penetrant variant causes disease, the lifetime risk \(P(D)\) is equivalent to the genotype frequency \(P(G)\). 
For an allele with frequency \(p\) (ignoring \ac{ld} for \ac{ar}), this translates to:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Autosomal Recessive:} \quad P(D) &= p^2, \\
\text{Autosomal Dominant:} \quad P(D) &= 2p(1-p) \approx 2p.
\end{aligned}
\]

When penetrance is incomplete, defined as \(P(D\mid G)\), the risk becomes:
$P(D) = P(G)\,P(D\mid G).$
In more realistic scenarios where multiple variants contribute to disease, \(P(G\mid D)\) denotes the fraction of cases attributable to a given variant. This leads to:

\[
P(D) = \frac{P(G)\,P(D\mid G)}{P(G\mid D)}.
\]
% 6. Validation studies
Because both penetrance and \(P(G\mid D)\) are often uncertain, solving this equation systematically poses a major challenge, which we incidentally tackled in the validation studies
\cite{minikel_quantifying_2016, whiffin_using_2017}. % Eric's \url{https://www.cureffi.org/2019/06/05/using-genetic-data-to-estimate-disease-prevalence/}.

Our framework addresses this challenge by combining variant classifications, population allele frequencies, and curated gene-disease associations. 
While imperfect on an individual level, these sources exhibit predictable aggregate behaviour, supported by James-Stein estimation principles \cite{efron_steins_1973}.
% Keep this thought here: Stein's Estimation Rule and its competitors, as discussed by Efron and Morris (1973), demonstrate that shrinkage estimators, such as the James–Stein estimator, can outperform traditional maximum likelihood methods by “borrowing strength” across multiple parameters. In essence, even if individual estimates are noisy or imprecise, shrinking them towards a common value (or mean) improves the overall risk (mean squared error) of the estimates. This empirical Bayes approach shows that aggregate estimates tend to be well-calibrated, a principle we leverage in our work: although individual ClinVar variant classifications may be uncertain, their collective behaviour yields robust and reliable prior probabilities when combined with population allele frequencies and curated gene–disease associations.
Curated gene-disease associations help identify genes that are explainable for most disease cases, allowing us to approximate \(P(G\mid D)\) close to one. In this way, we obtain robust estimates of \(P(G)\) (the frequency of disease-associated genotypes), even when exact values of penetrance and case attribution remain uncertain.

This approach allows us to pre-calculate priors and summarise the overall pathogenic burden.
By focusing on a subset \(\mathcal{V}\) of variants that pass stringent filtering, where each \(P(G_i \mid D)\) is the probability that a case of disease \(D\) is attributable to variant(s) \(i\), we assume that, in aggregate,

\[
\sum_{i\in\mathcal{V}} P(G_i\mid D) \approx 1.
\]

Even if the cumulative contribution is slightly less than one, the resultant risk estimates remain robust within the broad \ac{cri}s typical of epidemiological studies. 
By incorporating these pre-calculated priors into a Bayesian framework, our method refines risk estimates and enhances clinical decision-making despite inherent uncertainties.

% 9. Novel PID classifications from genetic PPI and clinical features
% 11. Integration of variant probabilities into the IEI genetics framework
% 7. Genetic constraint in high-impact protein networks
% Our results refine risk calculations by incorporating \ac{moi} complexities and enhances clinicians’ understanding of expected variant occurrences, thereby improving diagnostic precision.
For the \ac{iei}-specific analysis, we demonstrated that immunophenotypic and network-derived features can jointly predict \ac{ppi} structure, enabling data-driven refinement of gene classifications. Simplified immune features (e.g.\ “T cell low”) were retained in our public database, while detailed cluster assignments were excluded due to their complexity. These results illustrate how structured annotations can support automated or machine learning–based analyses in larger cohorts.  

Because variant sets can be aggregated rather than limited to single-gene analyses, our framework complements established rare variant association tests such as \ac{skat} and \ac{acat} \cite{liu2019acat,li2020dynamic,wu2011rare,lee2012optimal}, and aligns with multi-omics integration approaches \cite{kong2018nature,howe2021within}. It remains compatible with \ac{acmg} guidelines \cite{richards2015standards}, related frameworks \cite{tavtigian2020fitting,li2017intervar}, and existing \ac{qc} standards \cite{pedersen2021effective,anderson2010data}. Standardised reporting systems, including \ac{acmg} Secondary Findings v3.2 \cite{miller2023acmg}, provide context for embedding these probabilistic results in clinical workflows.  

Comparison with AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores showed that variants most frequently observed in patients are typically classified as benign or uncertain, consistent with population allele frequencies. This distinction clarifies that current pathogenicity predictors assess molecular effect, not the probability of occurrence. Integrating variant-level priors with predictors such as AlphaMissense could therefore improve disease relevance estimation by incorporating gene-disease associations and \ac{moi}.  

Future work will extend this framework to additional variant classes and models, iteratively updating classical estimates with new data to refine probabilistic diagnostics and support more precise clinical decision-making.

\section{Conclusion}
We present a statistical framework that quantifies the probability that any variant contributes to disease by integrating observed genotypes with the possibility of unobserved alleles. It replaces binary classifications with continuous posterior probabilities and credible intervals that capture evidence strength and uncertainty. The approach combines population genetics, inheritance, and Bayesian inference to support inference from incomplete data and provides a reproducible metric for estimating diagnostic probability at gene, panel, or genome level. Although demonstrated in inborn errors of immunity, it is generalisable to other rare disease cohorts and enables quantitative genomic interpretation at scale.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Dataset}

Data from \ac{gnomad} v4 comprised 807,162 individuals, including 730,947 exomes and 76,215 genomes \cite{karczewski2020mutational}. This dataset provided 786,500,648 \ac{snv}s and 122,583,462 \ac{indel}s, with variant type counts of 9,643,254 synonymous, 16,412,219 missense, 726,924 nonsense, 1,186,588 frameshift and 542,514 canonical splice site variants. ClinVar data were obtained from the variant summary dataset (as of: 16 March 2025) available from the NCBI FTP site, and included 6,845,091 entries, which were processed into 91,319 gene classification groups and a total of 38,983 gene classifications; for example, the gene \textit{A1BG} contained four variants classified as likely benign and 102 total entries \cite{landrum_clinvar_2018}. For our analysis phase we also used \ac{dbnsfp} which consisted of a number of annotations for 121,832,908 \ac{snv}s 
\cite{liu_dbnsfp_2020}. 
The PanelAppRex core model contained 58,592 entries consisting of 52 sets of annotations, including the gene name, disease-gene panel ID, diseases-related features, confidence measurements.
\cite{lawless_panelapprex_2025}
\ac{ppi} network data was provided by \ac{stringdb}, consisting of 19,566 proteins and 505,968 interactions \cite{szklarczyk2025string}.
The \ac{hgvs} nomenclature is used with \ac{vep}-based codes for variant IDs.
AlphaMissense includes pathogenicity prediction classifications for 71 million variants in 19 thousand human genes \cite{cheng_accurate_2023, jun_cheng_2023_8208688}. We used these scores to compared against the probability of observing the same given variants.
\textbf{Box \ref{box:definitions}} list the definitions from the \ac{iuis} \ac{iei} for the major disease categories used throughout this study \cite{poli_human_2025}.

The following genes were used for disease cohort validations and examples.
We used the two most commonly reported genes from the \ac{iei} panel \ac{nfkb1} 
\cite{tuijnenburgNFKB12018,
who1997primary,
cunningham1999common,
oksenhendler2008infections}
and \ac{cftr} 
\cite{naito2023uk, castellani2013cftr2, Grasemann2023cftr}
to demonstrate applications in \ac{ad} and \ac{ar} disease genes, respectively.
We used \ac{scid}-specific genes 
\ac{ar} \ac{dclre1c},
\ac{ar} \ac{rag1},
\ac{xl} \ac{il2rg} to demonstrate a \ac{iei} subset disease phenotype of 
\ac{scid}.
We also used \ac{ad} \ac{tnfaip3} for other examples comparable to \ac{nfkb1} since it is also causes \ac{ad} pro-inflammatory disease but has more known ClinVar classifications at higher \ac{af} then \ac{nfkb1}.

\subsection{Variant classification occurrence probability}
To quantify the likelihood that an individual harbours a variant with a given disease classification, we compute the variant-level occurrence probability (\ac{vre}) for each variant.
As a starting point, we considered the classical \ac{hwe} for a biallelic locus:
$
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1,
$
where \(p\) is the allele frequency, \(q = 1 - p\), \(p^2\) represents the homozygous dominant, \(2pq\) the heterozygous, and \(q^2\) the homozygous recessive genotype frequencies. For disease phenotypes, particularly under \ac{ar} \ac{moi}, the risk is traditionally linked to the homozygous state (\(p^2\)); however, to account for compound heterozygosity across multiple variants, %we extend this by incorporating the contribution from other pathogenic alleles.
we allocated the overall gene-level risk proportionally among variants.

Our computational pipeline estimated the probability of observing a disease-associated genotype for each variant and aggregated these probabilities by gene and ClinVar classification. This approach included all variant classifications, not limited solely to those deemed ``pathogenic'', and explicitly conditioned the classification on the given phenotype, recognising that a variant could only be considered pathogenic relative to a defined clinical context. The core calculations proceeded as follows:

\paragraph{1. Allele frequency and total variant frequency.} 
\label{sec:min_risk}
For each variant \(i\) in a gene, the allele frequency was denoted as \(p_i\). For each gene (any genomic region or set), we defined the total variant frequency (summing across all reported variants in that gene) as:
$P_{\text{tot}} = \sum_{i \in \text{gene}} p_i$.
Note that, because each calculation is confined to one gene, no additional scaling was required for our primary analyses (\(P_{\text{tot}}\)). However, if this same unscaled summation is applied across regions or variant sets of differing size or dosage sensitivity, it can bias burden estimates. In such cases, normalisation by region length or incorporation of gene- or region-specific dosage constraints is recommended.

If any of the possible \ac{snv}  had no observed allele (\(p_i = 0\)), we assigned a minimal risk:
$p_i = \frac{1}{\max(AN) + 1}$
where \(\max(AN)\) was the maximum allele number observed for that gene. This adjustment ensured that a nonzero risk was incorporated even in the absence of observed variants in the reference database.

\paragraph{2. Occurrence probability based on \ac{moi}.}
The probability that an individual is affected by a variant depends on the \ac{moi}. For \textbf{\ac{ad}} and \textbf{\ac{xl}} variants, a single pathogenic allele suffices:
$p_{\text{disease},i} = p_i$.
For\textbf{ \ac{ar}} variants, disease manifests when two pathogenic alleles are present, either as homozygotes or as compound heterozygotes. We use:
$p_{\text{disease},i} = p_i \; P_{\text{tot}}$. % version 2

Under \ac{hwe}, the overall gene-level probability of an \ac{ar} genotype is
$P_{\text{AR}} \;=\; P_{\text{tot}}^2
\;=\;\sum_i p_i^2 \;+\; 2\sum_{i<j} p_i\,p_j$,
where \(P_{\text{tot}}=\sum_i p_i\). A naïve per-variant assignment
$p_i^2 + 2\,p_i\,(P_{\text{tot}} - p_i)$
would, when summed over all \(i\), double-count the compound heterozygous terms. 
To partition \(P_{\text{AR}}\) among variants without double counting, we allocate risk in proportion to each variant’s allele frequency:
$
p_{\text{disease},i}
=\frac{p_i}{P_{\text{tot}}}\times P_{\text{tot}}^2
= p_i\,P_{\text{tot}}$.

This ensures
$
\sum_i p_{\text{disease},i}
= \sum_i p_i\,P_{\text{tot}}
= P_{\text{tot}}^2,
$
recovering the correct \ac{ar} risk while attributing each variant its fair share of homozygous and compound-heterozygous contributions.

More simply, for \ac{ad} or \ac{xl} conditions a single pathogenic allele suffices, so the classification risk (e.g. benign, pathogenic) equals its population frequency. For \ac{ar} conditions two pathogenic alleles are required - either two copies of the same variant or one copy each of two different variants, so we divide the overall recessive risk among variants according to each variant’s share of the total classification frequency in that gene.

\paragraph{3. Expected case numbers and case detection probability.}
Given a population with \(N\) births (e.g. as seen in our validation studies, \(N = 69\,433\,632\)), the expected number of cases attributable to variant \(i\) was calculated as:
$E_i = N \cdot p_{\text{disease},i}$.
The probability of detecting at least one affected individual for that variant was computed as:
$P(\geq 1)_i = 1 - \bigl(1 - p_{\text{disease},i}\bigr)^N$.

\paragraph{4. Aggregation by gene and ClinVar classification.}
For each gene and for each ClinVar classification (e.g. ``Pathogenic'', ``Likely pathogenic'', ``Uncertain significance'', etc.), we aggregated the results across all variants. The classification grouping can be substituted by any alternative score system. The total expected cases for a given group was:
$E_{\text{group}} = \sum_{i \in \text{group}} E_i$,
and the overall probability of observing at least one case within the group was calculated as:
$P_{\text{group}} = 1 - \prod_{i \in \text{group}} \left(1 - p_{\text{disease},i}\right)$.

\paragraph{5. Data processing and implementation.}
We implemented the calculations within a \ac{hpc} pipeline and provided an example for a single dominant disease gene, \textit{TNFAIP3}, in the source code to enhance reproducibility. Variant data were imported in chunks from the annotation database for all chromosomes (1-22, X, Y, M). 

For each data chunk, the relevant fields were gene name, position, allele number, allele frequency, ClinVar classification, and HGVS annotations. 
Missing classifications (denoted by ``.'') were replaced with zeros and allele frequencies were converted to numeric values. % We then retained only the first transcript allele annotation for simplicity, as the analysis was based on genomic coordinates. 
Subsequently, the variant data were merged with gene panel data from PanelAppRex to obtain the disease-related \ac{moi} mode for each gene. 
For each gene, if no variant was observed for a given ClinVar classification (i.e. \(p_i = 0\)), a minimal risk was assigned as described above. 
Finally, we computed the occurrence probability, expected cases, and the probability of observing at least one case of disease using the equations presented.

The final results were aggregated by gene and ClinVar classification and used to generate summary statistics that reviewed the predicted disease observation probabilities.
We define the \emph{\ac{vre}} as the prior probability of observing a variant classified as the cause of disease 

\paragraph{6. Score-positive-total.}
For use as a simple summary statistic on the resulting user-interface, we defined the \emph{score-positive-total} as the total number of positively scored variant classifications within a given region (gene, locus, or variant set). 
Using the ClinVar classification assigned to a scale from$-5$ (benign) to $+5$ (pathogenic), we included only scores $> 0$, corresponding to some evidence of pathogenicity. 
The score-positive-total yields a non-normalised estimate of the prior probability that a phenotype is explained by known pathogenic variants.

\paragraph{7. Classification scoring system.}
\label{sec:classification_score}
Each ClinVar classification was assigned an integer score: pathogenic = +5, likely pathogenic = +4, pathogenic (low penetrance) = +3, likely pathogenic (low penetrance) = +2, conflicting pathogenicity = +2, likely risk allele/risk factor/association = +1, drug response/uncertain significance/no classification/affects/other/not provided/uncertain risk allele = 0, protective = –3, likely benign = –4, benign = –5. No further normalisation was applied. The resulting distribution (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:p_gene_summary_hist_patch3} A-B}) is naturally comparable to a zero-centred average rank (\textbf{C-D}). This straightforward, modular approach can be readily replaced by any comparable evidence-based classification system. Variants with scores  $\leq 0$ were omitted, since benign classifications do not inform disease likelihood in the score-positive-total summary.

\subsection{Bayesian framework for posterior probability of genetic diagnosis}

We developed a Bayesian framework to estimate the probability that at least one variant in a given genome or target set is both present and clinically relevant in a proband. The method combines variant-specific priors derived from any classification system or scoring scheme with a probabilistic model of genotype presence, incorporating both observed and unsequenced genomic positions.

\paragraph{Prior specification.}
Each variant \( i \) was assigned a prior probability \( p_i \) reflecting its likelihood of being relevant to the user's target interpretation. This could include, for example, being classified as pathogenic, benign, or uncertain significance, or being prioritised by a quantitative scoring scheme. The priors may be derived from allele frequency, expert curation, functional prediction, or any other source of variant-level evidence. The framework supports modular priors without constraint. % accurate diagnostic inference generally requires gene‑disease information, including the \ac{moi}, to determine whether one or multiple variants are needed to explain the phenotype.
In our implementation, priors are derived from ClinVar classification, gnomAD population frequency, and \ac{moi} specified with PanelAppRex gene-disease curation. We modelled the latent causality of each variant as a Beta distribution parameterised by
$\alpha_i = \text{round}(p_i \cdot A_N) + w$, 
$\beta_i = A_N - \text{round}(p_i \cdot A_N) + 1$,
where \( A_N \) is the total number of callable alleles at the site (e.g. \( A_N = 2n \) for \( n \) diploid individuals), and \( w \) is a small stabilising constant (typically \( w = 1 \)). This construction reflects the expected frequency of the variant in the tested cohort under the assumption of causal relevance.

\paragraph{Posterior simulation.}
We drew \( N = 10{,}000 \) samples from the Beta prior to approximate a posterior distribution for each variant:
$\theta_i^{(m)} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_i, \beta_i), \quad m = 1,\dots,N$.
In each simulation round, these values were normalised across all variants to reflect the relative share of the total causal signal:
$$
\tilde{\theta}_i^{(m)} = \frac{\theta_i^{(m)}}{\sum_j \theta_j^{(m)}}, \qquad \hat{P}_i = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=1}^{N} \tilde{\theta}_i^{(m)}.
$$

This yields a posterior expectation of variant-level contribution, which can be thresholded or ranked depending on the application.

\paragraph{Genotype presence model.}
Independently from the classification or interpretive context, each variant was assigned a probability \( q_i \in [0,1] \) of being present in the proband. For observed alternate genotypes, \( q_i = 1 \); for confidently called reference genotypes, \( q_i = 0 \); and for unsequenced or uncertain sites, \( q_i \) was set to the prior probability \( p_i \), or an alternative estimate reflecting presence likelihood.
For each simulation round, we drew a genotype indicator:
$G_i^{(m)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(q_i)$,
and computed the total interpreted variant probability:
$
T^{(m)} = \sum_i G_i^{(m)} \cdot \tilde{\theta}_i^{(m)}$.
The empirical distribution of \( \{T^{(m)}\} \) represents the posterior belief that the proband harbours at least one variant matching the specified interpretive criteria in the given gene or set. Summary statistics, such as the posterior median and 95\% credible interval, are used to report this probability with interval-based accountability.

\paragraph{Flexibility and implementation.}
This framework generalises across different scoring systems, prior models, and sequencing contexts. It can incorporate uncertain classifications, variant weights, unsequenced positions, or alternative genotype priors without altering the core inference structure. The method is implemented in R with modular inputs and reproducible simulation logic.

\subsection{Application to diagnostic scenarios with observed and unobserved variant data}
% \subsection{Integrating observed true positives and unobserved false negatives into a single, actionable conclusion}

In this section, we detail our approach to integrating sequencing data with prior classification evidence (e.g. pathogenic on ClinVar) to calculate the posterior probability of a complete successful genetic diagnosis.
Our method is designed to account for possible outcomes of 
\ac{tp},
% \ac{fp},
\ac{tn},
and \ac{fn},
by first ensuring that all nucleotides corresponding to known variant classifications (benign, pathogenic, etc.) have been accurately sequenced. 
This implies the use of \ac{gvcf}-style data which refer to \ac{vcf}s that contain a record for every position in the genome (or interval of interest) regardless of whether a variant was detected at that site or not.
Only after confirming that these positions match the reference alleles (or novel unaccounted variants are classified) do we calculate the probability that additional, alternative pathogenic variants (those not observed in the sequencing data) could be present. 
Our \ac{cri} for pathogenicity thus incorporates uncertainty from the entire process, including the tally of \ac{tp}, \ac{tn}, and \ac{fn} outcomes.
We ignore the contribution of \ac{fp}s  as a separate task to be tackled in the future.

We estimated, for every query (e.g. gene or disease-panel), the posterior probability that at least one constituent allele is both damaging and causal in the proband.  
The workflow comprises four consecutive stages.

\paragraph{(i) Data pre‑processing.}
We synthesized an example patient in a disease cohort of 200 cases.
We made several scenarios where a causal genetic diagnosis based on the available data is either simple, difficult, or impossible.
Our example focused on a proband two representative genes for \ac{ad} \ac{iei}: \ac{nfkb1} and  \ac{tnfaip3}.
All coding and canonical splice‑region variants for \ac{nfkb1} were extracted from the gVCF.  
We assumed a typical \ac{qc} scenario, where sites corresponding to previously reported pathogenic alleles were checked for read depth \mbox{$\ge\!10$} and genotype quality \mbox{$\ge\!20$}.  
Positions that failed this check were labelled \emph{missing}, thus separating true reference calls from non-sequenced or uninformative sequence.

\paragraph{(ii) Evidence mapping and occurrence probability.}
PanelAppRex variants were annotated with ClinVar clinical significance.  Each label was converted to an ordinal evidence score $S_i\in[-5,5]$ and rescaled to a pathogenic weight $W_i=\operatorname{rescale}(S_i;\,-5,5\rightarrow0,1)$.  
This scoring system can be replaced with any comparable alternative.
The HWE-based pipeline of Section \ref{sec:min_risk} supplied a per‑variant occurrence probability $p_i$.  The adjusted prior was
$p_{i}^{\ast}=W_i\,p_i,$ and
$\mathrm{flag}_i\in\{\text{present},\text{missing}\}$.

\paragraph{(iii) Prior specification.}
In a hypothetical cohort of $n=200$ diploid individuals the count of allele~$i$ follows a Beta-Binomial model.  Marginalising the Binomial yields the Beta prior
$\pi_i\sim\mathrm{Beta}\!\bigl(\alpha_i,\beta_i\bigr)$,
$\alpha_i=\mathrm{round}(2np_{i}^{\ast})+\tilde w_i,\;
\beta_i = 2n-\mathrm{round}(2np_{i}^{\ast})+1$,
where $\tilde w_i=\max(1,S_i+1)$ contributes an additional pseudo‑count whenever $S_i>0$.

\paragraph{(iv) Posterior simulation and aggregation.}
For each variant $i$ we drew $M=10\,000$ realisations $\pi_{i}^{(m)}$ and normalised within each iteration,
$\tilde\pi_{i}^{(m)}=\frac{\pi_{i}^{(m)}}{\sum_{j}\pi_{j}^{(m)}}$.
Variants with $S_i>4$ were deemed to have evidence as \emph{causal} (pathogenic or likely pathogenic). 
We note that an alternative evidence score or conditional threshold can be substituted for this step.
Their mean posterior share $\bar\pi_i=M^{-1}\sum_m\tilde\pi_{i}^{(m)}$ and $95\%$ \ac{cri} were retained.  The probability that a damaging causal allele is physically present was obtained by a second layer:
$P^{(m)}=\sum_{i:\,S_i>3}\tilde\pi_{i}^{(m)}\,G_{i}^{(m)}$, and
$G_{i}^{(m)}\sim\mathrm{Bernoulli}(g_i)$,
with $g_i=1$ for present variants, $g_i=0$ for reference calls, and $g_i=p_i$ for missing variants.  The gene‑level estimate is the median of $\{P^{(m)}\}_{m=1}^{M}$ and its $2.5^{\text{th}}$/$97.5^{\text{th}}$ percentiles.

\paragraph{(v) Scenario analysis.}
The three scenarios were explored for a causal genetic diagnosis that is either simple, difficult, or impossible given the existing data.
The proband spiked data had either:
(1) known classified variants only, including only one known \ac{tp} pathogenic variant, \ac{nfkb1}  \texttt{p.Ser237Ter}, 
(2) inclusion of an additional plausible yet non-sequenced splice‑donor allele \ac{nfkb1}  \texttt{c.159+1G{\small\textgreater}A} (likely pathogenic) as a \ac{fn}, and 
(3) where no known causal variants were present for a patient, one representative variant from each distinct ClinVar classification was selected and marked as unsequenced to emulate a range of putative \acp{fn}. The selected variants were: \ac{tnfaip3} \texttt{p.Cys243Arg} (pathogenic), \texttt{p.Tyr246Ter} (likely pathogenic), \texttt{p.His646Pro} (conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity), \texttt{p.Thr635Ile} (uncertain significance), \texttt{p.Arg162Trp} (not provided), \texttt{p.Arg280Trp} (likely benign), \texttt{p.Ile207Leu} (benign/likely benign), and \texttt{p.Lys304Glu} (benign). 
All subsequent steps were identical.

\subsection{Validation of autosomal dominant estimates using \textit{NFKB1}}

To validate our genome-wide probability estimates in an \ac{ad} gene, we focused on \ac{nfkb1}. 
Our goal was to compare the expected number of \ac{nfkb1}-related \ac{cvid} cases, as predicted by our framework, with the reported case count in a well-characterised national-scale \ac{pid} cohort.

\paragraph{1. Reference dataset.}
We used a reference dataset reported by \citet{tuijnenburgNFKB12018} to build a validation model in an \ac{ad} disease gene. This study performed whole-genome sequencing of 846 predominantly sporadic, unrelated \ac{pid} cases from the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort. There were 390 \ac{cvid} cases in the cohort. The study identified \ac{nfkb1} as one of the genes most strongly associated with \ac{pid}. Sixteen novel heterozygous variants including truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants, were found in \ac{nfkb1} among the \ac{cvid} cases.

\paragraph{2. Cohort prevalence calculation.}
Within the cohort, 16 out of 390 \ac{cvid} cases were attributable to \ac{nfkb1}. 
Thus, the observed cohort prevalence was
$
\text{Prevalence}_{\text{cohort}} = \frac{16}{390} \approx 0.041$,
with a 95\% confidence interval (using Wilson's method) of approximately \((0.0254,\,0.0656)\).

\paragraph{3. National estimate based on literature.}
Based on literature
\cite{tuijnenburgNFKB12018, who1997primary, oksenhendler2008infections},
the prevalence of \ac{cvid} in the general population was estimated as
$\text{Prevalence}_{\text{CVID}} = \frac{1}{25\,000}$.
For a UK population of  $N_{\text{UK}} \approx 69\,433\,632,$
the expected total number of \ac{cvid} cases was
$E_{\text{CVID}} \approx \frac{69\,433\,632}{25\,000} \approx 2777.$
Assuming that the proportion of \ac{cvid} cases attributable to \ac{nfkb1} is equivalent to the cohort estimate, the literature extrapolated estimate is
$\text{Estimated NFKB1 cases} \approx 2777 \times 0.041 \approx 114$,
with a median value of approximately 118 and a 95\% confidence interval of 70 to 181 cases (derived from posterior sampling).

\paragraph{4. Bayesian adjustment.}
Recognising that the sequenced cohort cases likely captures the majority of \ac{nfkb1}‑related patients (apart from close relatives), but may still miss rare or geographically dispersed variants, we combined the cohort-based and literature-based estimates using two complementary Bayesian approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Weighted adjustment (emphasising the cohort, \(w=0.9\)):}  
  We assigned \(90\%\) weight to the directly observed cohort count (16) and \(10\%\) to the extrapolated population estimate (114), thereby accounting, illustratively, for a small fraction of unobserved cases while retaining confidence in our well‑characterised cohort:
$  \text{Adjusted Estimate}
    = 0.9 \times 16 \;+\; 0.1 \times 114
    \;\approx\; 26$,
  yielding a 95\% \ac{cri} of roughly 21 to 33 cases.
  \item \textbf{Mixture adjustment (equal weighting, \(w=0.5\)):}  
  To reflect greater uncertainty about how representative the cohort is, we combined cohort and population prevalences equally. 
  We sampled from the posterior distribution of the cohort prevalence,
   $p \sim \mathrm{Beta}(16 + 1,\,390 - 16 + 1)$,
  and mixed this with the literature-based rate at \(50\%\) each \cite{tuijnenburgNFKB12018, who1997primary, oksenhendler2008infections}. 
  This yields a median estimate of 67 cases and a wider 95\% \ac{cri} of approximately 43 to 99 cases, capturing uncertainty in both under-ascertainment and over-generalisation.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{5. Predicted total genotype counts.}
The predicted total synthetic genotype count (before adjustment) was 456, whereas the predicted total genotypes adjusted for \texttt{synth\_flag} was 0. 
This higher synthetic count was set based on a minimal risk threshold, ensuring that at least one genotype is assumed to exist (e.g. accounting for a potential unknown de novo variant) even when no variant is observed in gnomAD (as per \textbf{section
\ref{sec:min_risk}}).

\paragraph{6. Validation test.}
Thus, the expected number of \ac{nfkb1}-related \ac{cvid} cases derived from our genome-wide probability estimates was compared with the observed counts from the UK-based \ac{pid} cohort. 
This comparison validates our framework for estimating disease incidence in \ac{ad} disorders.

% Annotated key values from R:
% Predicted total genotypes (adjusted for synth_flag): 0 
% Predicted total synthetic genotype count: 456 
% Reported NFKB1-related CVID cases (n_NFKB1): 16 
% Literature extrapolated estimate median: 118 
% 95% CI for literature extrapolated estimate: [70, 181] 
% Bayesian mixture adjusted estimate (w = 0.5) median: 67 
% 95% CI for Bayesian mixture adjusted estimate: [43, 99] 
% Bayesian adjusted estimated number of NFKB1-related CVID cases (w = 0.9): 26 
% 95% Bayesian adjusted CI (w = 0.9): [21, 33]

\subsection{Validation study for autosomal recessive CF using \textit{CFTR}}

To validate our framework for \ac{ar} diseases, we focused on \ac{cf}.
For comparability sizes between the validation studies, we analysed the most common \ac{snv} in the \ac{cftr} gene, typically reported as \texttt{p.Arg117His} (GRCh38 Chr 7:117530975 G/A, MANE Select HGVSp ENST00000003084.11: p.Arg117His).
Our goal was to validate our genome-wide probability estimates by comparing the expected number of \ac{cf} cases attributable to the \texttt{p.Arg117His} variant in \ac{cftr} with the nationally reported case count in a well-characterised disease cohort
\cite{naito2023uk, castellani2013cftr2, Grasemann2023cftr}.

\paragraph{1. Expected genotype counts.}
Let \( p \) denote the allele frequency of the \texttt{p.Arg117His} variant and \( q \) denote the combined frequency of all other pathogenic \ac{cftr} variants, such that
$q = P_{\text{tot}} - p \quad \text{with} \quad P_{\text{tot}} = \sum_{i \in \text{CFTR}} p_i$.
Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for an \ac{ar} trait, the expected frequencies were:
$f_{\text{hom}} = p^2$ (homozygous for p.Arg117His)
and
$f_{\text{comphet}} = 2p\,q$ 
(compound heterozygotes carrying p.Arg117His and another pathogenic allele).
For a population of size \( N \) (here, \( N \approx 69\,433\,632 \)), the expected number of cases were:
$E_{\text{hom}} = N \cdot p^2,\quad E_{\text{comphet}} = N \cdot 2p\,q,\quad E_{\text{total}} = E_{\text{hom}} + E_{\text{comphet}}$.

\paragraph{2. Mortality adjustment.}
Since \ac{cf} patients experience increased mortality, we adjusted the expected genotype counts using an exponential survival model \cite{naito2023uk, castellani2013cftr2, Grasemann2023cftr}. With an annual mortality rate \(\lambda \approx 0.004\) and a median age of 22 years, the survival factor was computed as:
$S = \exp(-\lambda \cdot 22)$.
Thus, the mortality-adjusted expected genotype count became:
$E_{\text{adj}} = E_{\text{total}} \times S$.

\paragraph{3. Bayesian uncertainty simulation.}
To incorporate uncertainty in the allele frequency \( p \), we modelled \( p \) as a beta-distributed random variable:
\[
p \sim \mathrm{Beta}(p \cdot \text{AN}_{\text{eff}} + 1,\; \text{AN}_{\text{eff}} - p \cdot \text{AN}_{\text{eff}} + 1),
\]
using a large effective allele count (\(\text{AN}_{\text{eff}}\)) for illustration. 
By generating 10,000 posterior samples of \( p \), we obtained a distribution of the literature-based adjusted expected counts, \(E_{\text{adj}}\).

\paragraph{4. Bayesian Mixture Adjustment.}
Since the national registry may not capture all nuances (e.g., reduced penetrance) of \ac{cftr}-related disease, we further combined the literature-based estimate with the observed national count (714 cases from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry 2023 Annual Data Report) using a 50:50 weighting:
\[
E_{\text{Bayes}} = 0.5 \times (\text{Observed Count}) + 0.5 \times E_{\text{adj}}.
\]

\paragraph{5. Validation test.}
Thus, the expected number of \ac{cftr}-related \ac{cf} cases derived from our genome-wide probability estimates was compared with the observed counts from the UK-based \ac{cf} registry. This comparison validated our framework for estimating disease incidence in \ac{ad} disorders.

\subsection{Validation of SCID-specific estimates using PID–SCID genes}

To validate our genome-wide probability estimates for diagnosing a genetic variant in a patient with an \ac{pid} phenotype, we focused on a subset of genes implicated in \ac{scid}. Given that the overall panel corresponds to PID, but SCID represents a rarer subset, the probabilities were converted to values per million PID cases.

\paragraph{1. Incidence conversion.}
Based on literature, \ac{pid} occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 births, whereas \ac{scid} occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 births. 
Consequently, in a population of 1,000,000 births there are about 1,000 \ac{pid} cases and 10 \ac{scid} cases. 
To express \ac{scid}-related variant counts on a per-million \ac{pid}  scale, the observed \ac{scid} counts were multiplied by 100. 
For example, if a gene is expected to cause \ac{scid} in 10 cases within the total \ac{pid} population, then on a per-million \ac{pid}  basis the count is 10 × 100 = 1,000 cases (across all relevant genes).

\paragraph{2. Prevalence calculation and data adjustment.}
For each SCID-associated gene (e.g. \textit{IL2RG}, \textit{RAG1}, \ac{dclre1c}), the observed variant counts in the dataset were adjusted by multiplying by 100 so that the probabilities reflect the expected number of cases per 1,000,000 \ac{pid}. 
In this manner, our estimates are directly comparable to known counts from SCID cohorts, rather than to national population counts as in previous validation studies.

\paragraph{3. Integration with prior probability estimates.}
The predicted genotype occurrence probabilities were derived from our framework across the \ac{pid} gene panel. 
These probabilities were then converted to expected case counts per million  \ac{pid} cases by multiplying by 1,000,000. 
For instance, if the probability of observing a pathogenic variant in \textit{IL2RG} is \(p\), the expected \ac{scid}-related count becomes \(p \times 10^6\). Similar conversions are applied for all relevant \ac{scid} genes.

\paragraph{4. Bayesian Uncertainty and Comparison with Observed Data.}
To address uncertainty in the \ac{scid}-specific estimates, a Bayesian uncertainty simulation was performed for each gene to generate a distribution of predicted case counts on a per-million \ac{pid} scale. 
The resulting median estimates and 95\% \ac{cri}s were then compared against known national \ac{scid} counts compiled from independent registries. 
This comparison permuted a direct evaluation of our framework’s accuracy in predicting the occurrence of \ac{scid}-associated variants within a \ac{pid} cohort.

\paragraph{5. Validation Test.}
Thus, by converting the overall probability estimates to a per-million \ac{pid} scale, our framework was directly validated against observed counts for \ac{scid}. %This procedure confirms that our probability estimation approach can be effectively adapted to specific subphenotypes within a broader disease spectrum, ensuring robust application for both global PID and SCID diagnostics.

\subsection{Protein network and genetic constraint interpretation}
A \ac{ppi} network was constructed using protein interaction data from \ac{stringdb} \cite{szklarczyk2025string}. We previously prepared and reported 
on this dataset consisting of 19,566 proteins and 505,968 interactions 
(\url{https://github.com/DylanLawless/ProteoMCLustR}).
Node attributes were derived from log-transformed score-positive-total values, which informed both node size and colour. Top-scoring nodes (top 15 based on score) were labelled to highlight prominent interactions. To evaluate group differences in score-positive-total across major disease categories, one-way \ac{anova} was performed followed by Tukey \ac{hsd} post hoc tests (and non-parametric Dunn’s test for confirmation). 
GnomAD v4.1 constraint metrics data was used for the \ac{ppi} analysis and was sourced from \citet{karczewski2020mutational}.
This provided transcript-level metrics, such as observed/expected ratios, \ac{loeuf}, \ac{pli}, and Z-scores, quantifying \ac{lof} and missense intolerance, along with confidence intervals and related annotations for 211,523 observations.

\subsection{Gene set enrichment test}

To test for overrepresentation of biological functions, the prioritised genes were compared against gene sets from MsigDB (including hallmark, positional, curated, motif, computational, GO, oncogenic, and immunologic signatures) and WikiPathways using hypergeometric tests with FUMA \cite{watanabe_functional_2017, liberzon_molecular_2011}.
The background set consisted of 24,304 genes. Multiple testing correction was applied per data source using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and gene sets with an adjusted P-value $\le$ 0.05 and more than one overlapping gene are reported.

\subsection{Deriving novel PID classifications by genetic PPI and clinical features}
We recategorised 315 immunophenotypic features from the original \ac{iuis} \ac{iei} annotations, reducing the original multi-level descriptors (e.g. ``decreased CD8, normal or decreased CD4'') first to 
minimal labels (e.g.``low'') and second to binary outcomes (normal vs. not-normal) for T cells, B cells, neutrophils, and immunoglobulins %(\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:immunophenotype_before_after}}). 
Each gene was mapped to its \ac{ppi} cluster derived from \ac{stringdb} and \ac{umap} embeddings from previous steps. 
We first tested for non-random associations between these four binary immunophenotypes and \ac{ppi} clusters using $\chi^2$ tests. %(see Figure \ref{fig:multicat_patch_3_clust_chi}). 
To generate a data-driven PID classification, we trained a decision tree (rpart) to predict \ac{ppi} cluster membership from the four immunophenotypic features plus the traditional \ac{iuis} Major and Subcategory labels. 
Hyperparameters (complexity parameter = 0.001, minimum split = 10, minimum bucket = 5, maximum depth = 30) were optimised via five-fold cross validation using the \texttt{caret} framework. 
Terminal node assignments were then relabelled according to each group’s predominant abnormal feature profile.

\subsection{Probability of observing AlphaMissense pathogenicity}
We obtained the subset pathogenicity predictions from AlphaMissense via the AlphaFold database and whole genome data from the studies data repository\cite{cheng_accurate_2023, jun_cheng_2023_8208688}. 
The AlphaMissense data (genome-aligned and amino acid substitutions) were merged with the panel variants based on genomic coordinate and HGVSc annotation. 
Occurrence probabilities were log-transformed and adjusted (y-axis displaying log10(occurrence prob + 1e-5) + 5)), to visualise the distribution of pathogenicity scores across the residue sequence. 
A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the observed disease probability across clinical classification groups.

\subsection{Probability model definitions}
Estimating disease risk requires accounting for both variant penetrance, $P(D\mid G)$, where $D$ denotes the disease state and $G$ the genotype, and the fraction of cases attributable to a given variant, $P(G\mid D)$. In a fully penetrant single-variant model ($P(D\mid G)=1$), the lifetime risk $P(D)$ equals the genotype frequency $P(G)$. For an allele with population frequency $p$, this gives $P(D)=p^2$ for a recessive mode of inheritance and $P(D)=2p(1-p)\approx2p$ for a dominant mode. With incomplete penetrance, $P(D)=P(G)\,P(D\mid G)$, and when multiple variants contribute to disease,  

\[
P(D)=\frac{P(G)\,P(D\mid G)}{P(G\mid D)}.
\]

Because both $P(D\mid G)$ and $P(G\mid D)$ are often uncertain, we integrate ClinVar clinical classifications, population allele frequencies and curated gene–disease associations, assuming James-Stein shrinkage to derive robust aggregate priors. By focusing on a filtered set of variants $\mathcal{V}$ where each $P(G_i\mid D)$ is the probability that disease $D$ is attributable to variant $i$ and assuming $\sum_{i\in\mathcal{V}}P(G_i\mid D)\approx1$, we obtain calibrated estimates of genotype frequency $P(G)$ despite uncertainty in individual parameters.

\subsection{Validation studies}
\subsubsection{Validation of dominant disease occurrence with \textit{NFKB1}}

To validate our genome-wide probability estimates for \ac{ad} disorders, we focused on \ac{nfkb1}.
We used a reference dataset from \citet{tuijnenburgNFKB12018}, in which whole-genome sequencing of 846 \ac{pid} patients identified \ac{nfkb1} as one of the genes most strongly associated with the disease, with 16 \ac{nfkb1}-related \ac{cvid} cases attributed to \ac{ad} heterozygous variants. 
Our goal was to compare the predicted number of \ac{nfkb1}-related \ac{cvid} cases with the reported count in this well-characterised national-scale cohort.

Our model calculated 0 known pathogenic variant \ac{nfkb1}-related \ac{cvid} cases in the UK with a minimal risk of 456 unknown de novo variants. In the reference cohort, 16 \ac{nfkb1} \ac{cvid} cases were reported. 
We additionally wanted to account for potential under-reporting in the reference study. 
We used an extrapolated national \ac{cvid} prevalence which yielded a median estimate of 118 cases (95\% CI: 70–181), while a Bayesian-adjusted mixture estimate produced a median of 67 cases (95\% CI: 43–99). \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:validation_studies_bayesian_adjusted_estimates} (A)} illustrates that our predicted values reflect these ranges and are closer to the observed count. 
This case supports the validity of our integrated probability estimation framework for \ac{ad} disorders, and represents a challenging example where pathogenic \ac{snv} are not reported in the reference population of gnomAD. Our min-max values successfully contained the true reported values.

  The blue curve represents maximum count of 1280, and the orange curve shows the Bayesian-adjusted mixture estimate of 835. 
(B) Density distributions for \ac{cftr}-related \texttt{p.Arg117His} \ac{cf} cases.

The blue curve represents maximum extrapolated count of 740, and the orange curve shows the Bayesian-adjusted mixture estimate of 727. We observed close agreement among the reported disease cases and our integrated probability estimation framework.}

\subsubsection{Validation of recessive disease occurrence with \textit{CFTR}}

Our analysis predicted the number of \ac{cf} cases attributable to carriage of the \texttt{p.Arg117His} variant (either as homozygous or as compound heterozygous with another pathogenic allele) in the UK. Based on \ac{hwe} calculations and mortality adjustments, we predicted approximately 648 cases arising from biallelic variants and 160 cases from homozygous variants, resulting in a total of 808 expected cases.

In contrast, the nationally reported number of \ac{cf} cases was 714, as recorded in the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry 2023 Annual Data Report
\cite{naito2023uk}. To account for factors such as reduced penetrance and the mortality-adjusted expected genotype, we derived a Bayesian-adjusted estimate via posterior simulation. Our Bayesian approach yielded a median estimate of 740 cases (95\% \ac{ci}: 696, 786) and a mixture-based estimate of 727 cases (95\% \ac{ci}: 705, 750).
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:validation_studies_bayesian_adjusted_estimates} (B)} illustrates the close concordance between the predicted values, the Bayesian-adjusted estimates, and the national report supports the validity of our approach for estimating disease.

\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:validation_scatter_dense}} shows the final values for these genes of interest in a given population size and phenotype. It reveals that an allele frequency threshold of approximately 0.000007 is required to observe a single heterozygous carrier of a disease-causing variant in the UK population for both genes. However, owing to the \ac{ar} \ac{moi} pattern of \ac{cftr}, this threshold translates into more than 100,000 heterozygous carriers, compared to only 456 carriers for the \ac{ad} gene \ac{nfkb1}. Note that this allele frequency threshold, being derived from the current reference population, represents a lower bound that can become more precise as public datasets continue to grow. This marked difference underscores the significant impact of \ac{moi} patterns on population carrier frequencies and the observed disease prevalence.

\subsubsection{Validation of SCID-specific disease occurrence}

Given that \ac{scid} is a subset of \ac{pid}, our probability estimates reflect the likelihood of observing a genetic variant as a diagnosis when the phenotype is \ac{pid}. 
However, we additionally tested our results against \ac{scid} cohorts in 
 \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:scid_combined}}.
The summarised raw cohort data for SCID-specific gene counts are summarised and compared across countries in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:scid_gene_comparison}}.
True counts for \textit{IL2RG} and \ac{dclre1c} from ten distinct locations yielded 95\% \ac{ci} surrounding our predicted values. 
For \ac{il2rg}, the prediction was low (approximately 1 case per 1,000,000 \ac{pid}), as expected since loss-of-function variants in this \ac{xl} gene are highly deleterious and rarely observed in gnomAD. In contrast, the predicted value for \ac{rag1} was substantially higher (553 cases per 1,000,000 \ac{pid}) than the observed counts (ranging from 0 to 200). 
We attributed this discrepancy to the lower penetrance and higher background frequency of \ac{rag1} variants in recessive inheritance, whereby reference studies may underreport the true national incidence. 
Overall, we report that agreement within an order of magnitude was tolerable given the inherent uncertainties from reference studies arising from variable penetrance and allele frequencies.

    The figure presents density distributions for the predicted SCID case counts (per 1,000,000 PID) for three genes: \textit{IL2RG}, \textit{RAG1}, and \ac{dclre1c}. Country-specific rates (displayed as dotted vertical lines) are overlaid with the overall predicted distributions for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (solid lines with annotated medians). For \textit{IL2RG}, the low predicted value is consistent with the high deleteriousness of loss-of-function variants in this X-linked gene, while \textit{RAG1} exhibits considerably higher predicted counts, reflecting its lower penetrance in an autosomal recessive context.}
