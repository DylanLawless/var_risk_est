% Hardy (1908) provides a short mathematical proof that genotype and allele frequencies remain stable across generations under random mating, countering the misconception that dominant traits inevitably increase in frequency. This letter introduced the principle now known as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

% Seminal paper laying the foundations of population genetics. Wright develops mathematical models describing how evolutionary forces affect gene frequencies; including mutation, migration, selection, genetic drift, and population size.  Introduces the concept of random genetic drift and its consequences for heterozygosity, equilibrium states, and adaptive evolution. Explores gene frequency distributions under various evolutionary scenarios and discusses how these shape the dynamics of Mendelian systems. Central to modern understanding of evolutionary processes in finite populations.
